### In the file TSP.txt, there are Cartesian coordinates of 100 cities that a traveling salesman should visit, starting from the first city (the first column in the file contains city identifiers).

# Task 1
### Write code to calculate the length of any path that is a solution to the traveling salesman problem (not necessarily an optimal solution, but a path that starts and ends in the same city and visits each city exactly once). Such a path can be best represented as a vector being a permutation of city numbers. The length should be calculated using the Euclidean distance between points (i.e., sqrt((xi - xj)^2 + (yi - yj)^2), where xi and yi are the coordinates of cities, and i and j are their identifiers).

# Task 2
### Finding the best solution is not feasible in a reasonable time here. Using any method (it can be an approximation algorithm from the lecture, any heuristic algorithm, or your own algorithm), try to find the best possible solution to this problem.

# Task 3
### In the report, describe the algorithm you used and present the obtained results. Compare your solution with the solution obtained by going through all cities in the order from the file. Did you achieve any improvement(% improvement)? Provide the time it took to find the best path.
