##The knapsack problem is defined as follows:

- You are given a set of items with specified dimensions and values.
- The goal is to place the items in a knapsack in such a way that their total value is maximized.
- The knapsack has a defined capacity.

##This problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems.

#Task 1
##Solve the discrete knapsack problem operating in two dimensions using any approximation algorithm (other than the one used in the previous exercise). Each item in the knapsack has a width and height that must be considered when placing it in the knapsack. Items can be rotated. Each item also has a value that must be taken into account when searching for the optimal solution. The input data is provided in the "packages" file, which contains several sets of data. Observe how the processing time increases with the increase in the knapsack's size and the number of items.

In the report:

- Describe the algorithm used and its parameters.
- Present the obtained results.
- Compare the results of your algorithm with the greedy algorithm.
- Provide the execution time of the approximation algorithm and the greedy algorithm.
- Graphically show the contents of the knapsack after the operation of the approximation algorithm and the greedy algorithm for the smallest of the given datasets.
